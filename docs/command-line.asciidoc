== Command Line Options

Httpbeat does not have any Httpbeat-specific command line options. Instead, you
configure the behaviour of Httpbeat by specifying options in the configuration file.

The following command line options from libbeat are also available for Httpbeat. For
details about each option, see {libbeat}/command-line-options.html[Beats Command Line Options].

To start Httpbeat, you must use the `-c config/path` option to specify the path to the
